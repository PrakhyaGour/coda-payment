## terraform to provision 3-tier architecture on ECS with blue green deployment

This intends to create a basic 3 tier architecture with ECS and using codepipeline for blue/green deployment.

It provisions basic infrastructure for assignment purpose that can be further improved for production environments later on.

Possible improvments:
1. Terraform state can be stored on a S3 bucket.
2. Directory structure can be further improved.
3. Security can be improved.
4. Adding route53 entries for custom domain.
